# Spice Grab - Edamam API Recipe Search - A Code First Girls Project

Bunch of ingredients in your fridge and not sure what to do? We're here to help. Spice Grab is a Python program using the Edamam API to find, print, and save recipes based on user inputs. Users can choose their ingredient(s) and other search criteria, including preferred dietary requirements, health requirements, and calorie count. A list of recipes and links to each will be displayed and saved to a text file called 'My Recipes'.

<b> This is a collaborative final project presented with [HeidiWlk](https://github.com/HeidiWlk) at the end of our 8-week Introduction to Python course with Code First Girls. </b>

------

<b> Requirement: </b> Register to [Edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/) to generate an app ID and key. An example license has been inputted into the uploaded code.

We first started planning its features using the <i>[MoSCoW method](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/moscow-prioritization/)</i>.


Our program  <i><b> must </b></i>:
* Allow users to search for recipes by ingredients
* Display the recipes found
* Save all links to file (.txt)

<i><b> Should </b></i>:
* Have 'filters' or other search criteria such as diet type, cuisine type, calorie range etc.
* Can input multiple filters at the same time

<i><b> Could </b></i>:
* Include images of recipes as well
* Save ingredients / recipes as a shopping list
* Exclude ingredients

And <i><b> won't </b></i>:
* Search local stores for ingredient availability

Here is an example of user input in action: <br /> <br />
